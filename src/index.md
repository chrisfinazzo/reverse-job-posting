<p class="intro">If you have a message to communicate, I can help you do that. Currently working as a Page at <a href="https://chathamlibrary.org">The Library of The Chathams</a>, I have an MA in Communications and am actively seeking a role which will allow me to leverage my unique mix of communications and technology skills. Take a look at my <a href="/rjp/">Reverse Job Posting</a> to see how I can help you. I look forward to working <a href="/contact/">together</a>.<br /><br />When I'm not working, I sometimes write things on my <a href="https://chrisfinazzo.com">blog</a>.</p>
